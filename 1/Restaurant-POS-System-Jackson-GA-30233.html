<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>
<p>Clover is an all-in-one point-of-sale and payment system for restaurants that integrates the functions of a cash register, card payment terminal, and POS system. With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs.</p>
