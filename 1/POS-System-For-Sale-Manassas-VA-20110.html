<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

ShopKeep supports your business' email marketing plan by making it easy to capture customers' contact info and grow your email list.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet. We're not the best fit for everyone, and if our retail point of sale won't meet the needs of your retail business, we'll be the first to tell you.</p>

<p>The software permits you to issue receipts, track sales, and perform back-office functions. If the quality of the software, support, and services will prove itself as an investment — not just an extra business expense — it'll be worth it. You get to hit two birds with one stone by combining retail POS with ecommerce functionality, so you never miss a sale. It used to be that having a good product was enough to get you by.
