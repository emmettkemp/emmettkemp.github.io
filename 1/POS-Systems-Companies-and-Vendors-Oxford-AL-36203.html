<p>It is well know that technology has improved our personal lives. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner. Vend is EMV and NFC capable and integrates with Vantiv , PayPal , and Square for in-store credit card payments. A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service. If you have a chain of restaurants across the world and looking for a restaurant POS software to streamline your business then you can take a look at our eZee Optimus restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. These options may also encourage your customers to spend more money at your business. You can connect the POS system with most-used business applications and payment systems, like Paypal, Xero, and Quickbooks. In addition to helping owners and operators detect theft through detailed sales and inventory reporting, some bar and nightclub POS systems also offer cash drawer management to further protect against employee theft.</p>

<p>That said, Square for Restaurants also happens to be the one the best restaurant POS systems as far as flexibility is concerned- all thanks to the Square App Marketplace. The POS solution comes with all the benefits of the Shopify ecommerce platforms that power over 600,000 businesses and more than 1M active users worldwide. ShopKeep was founded by a retailer, so we get that no two businesses are alike. A sleek POS can also give your business a modern, professional feel that may impress customers.</p>
<p>The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. Square is a common favorite of mobile businesses like food trucks and boutique retail shops. Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. Another function of this mPOS is its connectivity to our Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Head Office (HO) software system.</p>

<p>Some POS software has built-in payment processing while others work with third-party integration. With some retail systems, you can buy your own computers and then buy the POS software for your business separately. DBSync , a pioneer in the field, allows for seamless integration, providing complete control over the business and optimizing sales. This feature helps protect a bar business from running out of product, which can be one of the most damaging forces to an exceptional customer experience.</p>
<p>Another significant advantage of using a restaurant management software is the ability to send orders directly to the kitchen - this is a considerable advantage by increasing food prep time, staff efficiency, and reducing errors in the kitchen. Offer better, quicker and more engaging service in total flexibility having any number of POS devices, no matter if stationary or mobile, to connect at the same time.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. Employee management: Employees can clock in, process payments, and enter product and customer information with these features. This will give you a huge number of combinations of hardware and software to choose from in order to find the very best iteration for your business. Additionally, its high- speed printer works as a connection hub, and with this software, business owners can manage their operations from anywhere.</p>
