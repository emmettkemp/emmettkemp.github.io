<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>We created Point of Success Special Edition for independent restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, bars, and quick service concepts like yours. The one thing that can take a long time when hiring a bartender for the first time is training them to learn your POS system. It comes with modules for material management, inventory, billing and kitchen management.

<p>Using a POS tool with a built-in loyalty program, you can create gift cards, punch cards, or any other loyalty program quickly and easily to ensure customers keep coming back and spending more. Lavu can accept and process payments made through channels like contactless payment methods, magnetic stripe cards, and chip cards, making the payment process a breeze not only for users but for customers as well.
