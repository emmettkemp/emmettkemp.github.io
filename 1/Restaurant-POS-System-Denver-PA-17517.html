<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>

Fortunately, this is where a restaurant management software comes in handy.</p>

<p>Most restaurant POS vendors, however, supply hardware as well as software. A retail management software offers managers to keep track of performance, sale volume and more even when they are not on the floor. Traditionally, the restaurant POS system is where a customer makes a payment in exchange for goods or services. At the heart of Bluestore Live is an admin console, in which a business's data is securely stored on BlueStore's servers living in the cloud or the company's own private URL.</p>
