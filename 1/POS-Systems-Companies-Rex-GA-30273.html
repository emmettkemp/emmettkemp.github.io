This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting.

<p>The components of a POS system include hardware, software and operational features. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors. POS software or POS systems are located wherever a transaction occurs, which generally tends to mean the terminal that is used for checkouts.</p>
