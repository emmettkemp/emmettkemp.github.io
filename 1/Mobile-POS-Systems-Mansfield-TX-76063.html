<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>A functioning POS gift card program can also help retain customers. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants.</p>

The best POS systems combine payment processing, inventory and customer management, payroll and accounting, and other services into powerful POS hardware and software packages. New or additional hardware will be needed to give these cards the ability to dip.‚Äù Some point-of-sales systems charge extra for that.</p>
<p>A variety of comprehensive restaurant management software is available for use. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The hardware components bundle will typically include a POS terminal, receipt printer, credit card reader, cash drawer, barcode scanner, kitchen or bar printer (for restaurants), and possibly even an on-site computer server for older legacy systems. A restaurant POS system is a significant business investment, and it's important to treat it as such.</p>

The Clover technology ensures a complete security system keeping the card data of your customers safe. Customers can proceed with credit cards, cash, check, debit cards, or maybe a gift card. Managing inventory in a retail business is very challenging because the stock is always in flux and the demand of items keeps shifting.</p>
<p>Toast POS improves customer service by enhancing staff efficiency and reducing costs. The inventory management features might feel limited if you're running a large restaurant business. Admittedly, quite a good bargain when you consider the thousands of dollars various restaurant businesses pay to acquire and install hardware POS. It barely costs you anything to send a thousand emails and your customers will be happy to hear from you.</p>
