<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. Cloud-based and on-premise solution that allows restaurants to streamline point-of-sale operations with scheduling, reporting and more. You can analyze sales data, figure out how well all the items on your shelves sell, and adjust purchasing levels accordingly.
