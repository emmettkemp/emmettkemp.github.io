<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. You also get dashboards, retail, and product report to gain insights into your store's growth and sales performance. If you already own a PC you can "create" a POS by purchasing the POS software and adding the peripherals you will need such as a cash drawer, credit card swiper, etc. High-traffic operations such as grocery outlets and cafes need to process sales quickly at the sales counter so the UI flow is often designed with as few popups or other interruptions to ensure the operator isn't distracted and the transaction can be processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>

<p>Its makers, Martin Goodwin and Bob Henry, are essentially the godfathers of modern POS, this being the critical moment that preceded a slew of Point of Sale applications being developed specifically for Microsoft and Unix operating systems.
