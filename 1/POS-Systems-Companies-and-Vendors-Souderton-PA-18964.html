It is interesting because you get a feel of sitting in a store and executing your test cases since POS requires setup as you would see in any stores.

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>
<p>Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table.

It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
