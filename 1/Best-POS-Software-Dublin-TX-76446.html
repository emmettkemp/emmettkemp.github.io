<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
<p>It performs all those functions that the aforementioned hardware applications are capable of. Besides, modern POS software applications also help in managing inventory. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver. Go for EMV-compliant POS (see above explanation) to protect customers and yourself from credit card fraud.</p>
<h2>POS Software Financing Dublin</h2>
<p>PAR Pay's gateway architecture provides real-time transaction visibility through a cloud-based portal, allowing anywhere access to view transaction and settlement details, analyze trends, reconcile payments with credit cards and manage chargebacks across all stores.

<p>Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch.

<p>Unlike the traditional cash register system where you cannot tell which staff member on shift rang up the sale, if you upgrade your POS equipment, you will be able to tell which staff member does what. With this software, you can increase your sales, track inventories, manage employees, and automate restaurant operations conveniently using your tablet. We're not the best fit for everyone, and if our retail point of sale won't meet the needs of your retail business, we'll be the first to tell you.</p>
