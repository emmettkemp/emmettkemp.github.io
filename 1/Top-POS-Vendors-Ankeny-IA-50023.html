<p>Inventory management is a necessity in every business, but more and more restaurants are realizing that it can be the difference between success and failure. NCR is a longtime provider of banking services, software, and hardware with experience at handling all areas of tablet POS. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory. The cloud-based Zomato Book POS provides a single platform restaurant operations management. POS Software is a computerized retail management system that takes advantage of the latest touch screen and scanning technologies, facilitating the rapid transaction processing necessary in a fast-paced retail environment.</p>
<p>Automatic Pricing saved retailers money by removing the need to place a physical price tag on each item and in reducing pricing errors made by cashiers. Pro Plus - For a monthly subscription fee of $359 plus $40 per POS terminal this plan supplements the Pro plan features with enterprise account management, data API, and custom reporting. But in general POS software packages contain features and functionality that will help you to manage easily all common customer related transactions that are needed in your business.</p>

With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction.</p>
