<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately.
