<p>From ensuring that there's enough inventory to putting together monthly sales reports, these skills are necessary in ensuring that your store runs smoothly. Remote POS management and reporting capability via the Lighthouse. For customers, POS kiosks are novel and fun, usually with shorter lines, and mobile ordering and purchasing saves them time. Customers prefer shopping at a store where there is more of a choice about how they pay for their items.</p>
