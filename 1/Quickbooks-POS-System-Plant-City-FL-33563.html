<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.</p>
<p>By making customer experience a central focus, retailers can transform their businesses to deliver unified, personalized customer experiences in-store, online, on the go and on a mobile or tablet device. The best POS vendors provide reliable customer support that you can contact around the clock, so even if your business keeps irregular hours or you're working late, you can receive help when you need it. These fees will be charged to your business based on how many transactions you run, how large each transaction is, and the type of card the customer is paying with.</p>

<p>Payment by check has historically offered an opportunity for fraud and lost revenues, but modern point of sale systems have introduced security tools to help minimize this possibility. Integrated employee time card systems schedule hours and generate payroll, and the inventory is intelligent and self-managing (set the items just one time and the inventory tracks and manages them from there on out, sending key alerts when items need to be reordered, and even printing order forms for vendors).</p>
<p>ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. Most retailers need an end-to-end retail management solution that provides them with centralized control and a real-time view of their operations for faster decision-making.
