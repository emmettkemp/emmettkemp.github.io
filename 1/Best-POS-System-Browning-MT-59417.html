<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. By nature of processing the outward flow of your business's inventory, point of sale systems—the best ones, anyway—keep track of where your inventory currently stands. When doing so, remember that you will need to invest in a server (unless the system will work with your existing one) retail software, accounting software, terminals (how many will you need?) Talking to other business owners is a good way to get an idea of the range of what's out there in terms of price.</p>

If you are operating a small or midsize bar, cloud-based POS software is likely the best option for your business. And with QuickBooks hardware and software, you can take any type of payment from just about any device—barcode scanner, touch screen terminal, iPad, or mobile reader.</p>

It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
<p>Multi tender transactions are also supported in Retail ADVANTAGE Point of Sale software program, that means you can have a customer use two or more types of payment on one transaction. Retail POS systems only need to carry out very basic functions like selling, returning, discounting, and tracking items.
