<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.

In a way, this is similar to the purpose behind restaurants: A restaurant's basic function is to feed people, but you and your staff do way more than that by creating delightful, memorable dining experiences.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online.

This not only means that you'll be able to serve a greater number of guests in a shorter amount of time, but also that your staff members can spend more time interacting with your guests and VIPs instead of maneuvering back and forth through the crowd to access a central payment terminal.</p>
