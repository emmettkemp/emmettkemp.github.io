<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. For a store that generates annual sales, the savings can be significant by utilising a POS system. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor. Omnichannel by design: Manhattan POS is equipped with all of the capabilities needed to turn stores into the center of your omnichannel experience: omni cart, omni fulfillment, returns, exchanges, cross-channel promotions, complete customer transaction and interaction history across channels, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can monitor the sales made by your servers and manage security permissions on the POS. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis. Mobile point of sale systems that utilize handheld tablets eliminate the clunky technology that typically stands between staff and guests.</p>

<p>Features include inventory and labor management, reports and analytics, scheduling, loyalty programs, a self-service kiosk, and a kitchen display system. The first one is the mobile payment system that, thanks to the use of WiFi tablets and mobile POS, allows an exclusive payment via mobile and card only, potentially everywhere in the store, reducing the time spent in a queue. Our standard restaurant point of sale includes a touchscreen POS terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and kitchen printer.</p>
<p>The solution helps you free up staff so they can focus on providing quality service to your customers.

<p>Illegal software dubbed "zappers" can be used on POS devices to falsify these records with a view to evading the payment of taxes. POS systems with advanced inventory management tools can track sales from both your e-commerce platform and your physical retail store in real time, or across multiple locations. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>

<p>Excellent for small businesses or online merchants that want to add an on-site presence. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment. Revel Systems makes it easy to incorporate features like discounts, gift cards, online ordering, and loyalty programs since all those features are built in to their platform.</p>
<p>We are honored to announce that the cross-platform, cross-channel POS and retail management software Retail Pro® was ranked number 1 retail mid-market POS in market share, global reach, innovation, and growth in the latest Retail Executive Advisory Program Research Study from IHL Group. If you are processing a layaway, you have to remove the merchandise from the floor yourself, because POS does not remove it from inventory until you actually sell it, and another sales associate may think you still have the item in stock.</p>

<p>Having a POS system that accepts several types of payments establishes credibility with customers as soon as they walk in your store. First we'll look at Point of Sale (POS) systems, then get into restaurant management software.

<p>All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. If POS software is the brains, then restaurant POS hardware is the brawn.
