The modern day POS system replaces legacy equipment like the old plug-in calculators, carbon copy credit card receipts and 10-digit registers (if you can remember back that far). Different types of restaurants have specific operational needs that must be met, and a good POS system must address those needs through the basic hardware as well as the software interface.</p>
