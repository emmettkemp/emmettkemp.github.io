<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Indeed, these systems are often well suited for small businesses because they are the least expensive of the POS system options, they nonetheless provide many helpful features, including automatic sales and tax calculation ability; calculation of change owed to the customer; sales report generation capability; capacity to sort food stamps and trading stamps (through programming of function keys); and scanning.</p>
<p>Most free POS software will only operate on a limited number of POS pieces of hardware. Thrive POS: This vendor offers the best POS system for pizza restaurants.

Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management.
