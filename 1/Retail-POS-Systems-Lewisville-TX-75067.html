Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business.

<p>Free POS Software can be used as a replacement to similar third-party versions employed in common retail establishments. Credit card processing rates through Lightspeed Payments are set at a predictable fee for all card types, including American Express: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction (2.6% + $0.30 card not present). When your sales staff enter the customers' name, they can quickly call up their entire purchase history and their email address.</p>
<p>How a customer experiences your brand when they visit your stores is a strong indicator as to whether they will become a repeat customer or leave you for competitors with better service. Sales reports are the cornerstone of every business and they provide an overview of all transactions over a period of time.
