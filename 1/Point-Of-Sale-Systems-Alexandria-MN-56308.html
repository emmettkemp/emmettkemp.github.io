STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits.

<h3>Basic Point Of Sale System Alexandria MN 56308</h3>
<p>POS systems help you track every sale, down to the penny while acting as a credit card processor. Food and beverage service businesses can benefit from Revel's customizable loyalty programs. Reports provide customer counts, sales information, and cost and historical data, on-site and remotely. If a customer wants a certain style or color that is not available at their location, a store associate will save the sale by helping the customer place the order from the store's iPad before they go.</p>
<p>So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look. When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
