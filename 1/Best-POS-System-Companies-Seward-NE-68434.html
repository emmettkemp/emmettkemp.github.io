Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Lightspeed is an iPad POS system that has solutions for retail stores, restaurants and online businesses. The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Upserve POS focuses on small restaurants but can also accommodate large, multilocation bars. For delivery restaurants, Revel lets employees quickly store customer information with an address field.
