<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>A big portion of these business owners are afraid of investing the time and money in a POS system to only end up regretting it because it just didn't work as they had hoped for.
