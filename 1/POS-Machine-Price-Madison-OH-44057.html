<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms. Your customers don't have to worry about keeping cash in their pockets all the time. This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow , food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously. QuickBooks POS is yours with a one-time payment: no more monthly, quarterly or annual payments to worry about.</p>
<h2>Integration With Point Of Sale Systems (POS) Madison</h2>
