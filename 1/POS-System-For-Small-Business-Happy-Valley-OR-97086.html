<p>This cloud-based iPad POS system is packed with features, such as inventory management for up to 10,000 items and 2 million SKUs, sales analytics to help you identify buying trends, and customer engagement tools that help you understand your customers. A restaurant POS solution is primarily defined by organizing orders by table, making it easy for the server to send customer orders to the kitchen. We've listed the most common hardware used by the retailer, but keep in mind that not every business needs all of these products.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Your POS may be able to take some of the more tedious or time-consuming parts of owning a small business off your hands, dramatically improving your efficiency. The best restaurant POS systems are so much more than order and till systems. As is based on the same platform as our Hostel PMS, the two systems are totally integrated - and all revenue postings from the POS are pushed to the PMS (regardless of folio charge or cash payment data).</p>
<p>More established businesses can take advantage of advanced features such as kitchen display systems, digital menu boards, online ordering and self-ordering kiosks. This configurable, full-scale POS system gives your staff the mobility to do the job in all areas of the restaurant. Most POS software helps you stay aware of how your business is performing. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated.</p>

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>
