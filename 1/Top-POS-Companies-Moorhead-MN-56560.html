<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. Some packages are designed specifically for food and beverage service businesses, like TouchBistro and Toast. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. It has different modules for billing, database management, order token management, employee and staff management, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing.

<p>The machine or system used by the restaurant to take your payment is termed their point of sale terminal. Cloud POS systems ensure all customer data is stored properly and securely. Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. Walmart stores suffered a major cyber attack on its POS system in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle.
