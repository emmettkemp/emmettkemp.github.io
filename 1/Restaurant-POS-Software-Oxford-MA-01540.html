<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets. In modern terms, a POS system is typically a POS software product installed on a touchscreen hardware device.

<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

<p>Restaurants stand and fall on the quality of their food and the friendliness and dedication of their staff.

A standard Revel POS terminal includes an iPad, payment device, POS stand, router, Wi-Fi access point, POS printer and a secure cash drawer. 15 On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with very high traffic.</p>
