<p>But when it comes to providing detailed sales reports, some systems blow others out of the water. Linga POS is an iPad POS system for restaurants from Benseron Hospitality. If the restaurant has primarily chosen a cloud-based POS system but their internet is not 100% reliable, they can connect an on-site server enabling the software to function when the internet is down and sync the data in the cloud when the internet is back up and running.</p>
<p>Restaurants stand and fall on the quality of their food and the friendliness and dedication of their staff. Mobile features use apps or mobile-friendly websites to allow customers to place orders or make purchases remotely using their phones, tablets or computers. A standard Revel POS terminal includes an iPad, payment device, POS stand, router, Wi-Fi access point, POS printer and a secure cash drawer. 15 On-premises installations are therefore sometimes seen alongside cloud-based implementation to preempt such incidents, especially for businesses with very high traffic.</p>
