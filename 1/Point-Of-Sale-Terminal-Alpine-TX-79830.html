Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Square markets a restaurant point-of-sale platform with software, hardware and payments to streamline operations. The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment.</p>

It helps saving much time and makes the credit card transaction easier. One popular system, the Square Point of Sale, is known for offering tiny dongles that will connect to a tablet and allow you to swipe credit cards while you're on the go. It's always good to know that this kind of mobility is available even if you might not need it right away.</p>
<p>Cost- Before finalizing the POS system, the user should consider the cost of it that includes the hardware and software price. This software has been around since 2008 and continues to be one of the best POS systems for retail. To get started, pair your POS software with one of our top inventory management software options. A vital element of POS hardware is the cash drawer. Payment is easy - at the beginning of the night, servers can start a tab in the POS for each customer, adding their name and payment card information so they don't have to ask again, allowing customers more convenience when they spend an evening in your bar.</p>

<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier.
