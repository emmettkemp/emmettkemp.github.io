<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>With the bar tab feature, pre-authorize credit cards so collecting payment is a breeze, and feel at ease because you won't be responsible for a stack of credit cards sitting behind the bar any longer. Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
