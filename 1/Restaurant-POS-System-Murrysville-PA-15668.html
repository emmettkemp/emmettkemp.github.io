<p>Your customers can pay with credit cards, debit cards, cash, and more. However, Receipt Paper is still a must-have for any small or medium-sized business because it brings quick snapshot to customers about their purchase. In addition to fulfill the general rules of catering as great customer services and good food, the first step is to have quality management which can support your promises.

A basic POS system might be nothing more than one cash register and the software necessary to collect sales data. The system comes with free downloadable software plus a Square magstripe reader, enabling payments via debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>Based on our evaluation, we found that Clover is most suitable as a fast food POS or for quick-service restaurants.

<p>We believe that restaurant point of sale and inventory management software should be mobile and affordable. Customers rate their experience alerting managers when a patron isn't satisfied with the service. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
