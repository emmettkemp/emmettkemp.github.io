Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Transactions are fully integrated into the sales process to allow for faster checkout experience for your customers. These features make it easy to accept payment from customers. Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>

<p>A reliable restaurant POS system is the difference between a coffee shop or bar that feels like a disorganized open market, and one where customers enjoy the convenience of ordering remotely from their mobile phones, or perhaps booking tables beforehand and then having their orders delivered right on time. Manage your sales, loyalty program and inventory from a smartphone or tablet. Any store that has a point of sale and point of purchase can use POS software.</p>
