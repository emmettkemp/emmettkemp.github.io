But retailers like you are creative, visionary people with many idea of how to improve your in-store experience. Innovative features make Touchbistro a standout among the many POS systems available to restaurant owners.

And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between POS systems and cash registers , but generally speaking, functionality is typically uniform across platforms in the sense that a POS machine is used to ring up sales and to accept payments. With an online POS, you can use your own hardware. Toast POS is one of the few providers of an Android POS system, which is more suitable for restaurants due to the flexibility and affordability of the Android infrastructure.</p>
