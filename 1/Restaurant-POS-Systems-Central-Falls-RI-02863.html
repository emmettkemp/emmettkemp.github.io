<p>POS is a short form for point of sale. Users can utilize numerous features for managing customer information, dashboards and reports, promotions and pricing, main product catalog, orders, inventory, and cash. However, a POS terminal is the electronic equipment performing the sales transaction and processing the credit card payments. Lightspeed users can also consult the Lightspeed Community to discuss their POS system with other retailers, restaurateurs and Lightspeed experts.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
