<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. Restaurants can choose high-end table management and reservations options or minimized features needed for fast food counters to food trucks. The restaurant POS industry charges per-month costs that vary depending on the number of terminals and locations, and whether you're only using software or need hardware as well. Because cashless payments are typically quicker and more efficient, which leave the customer with more time to do their thing.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
