<h2>Shop POS System Guadalupe CA</h2>
<p>POS system is a computerized network that consists of the main computer linked with several checkout terminals and supported by different hardware features starting from barcode scanners and ending with card payment terminals. RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store. We've provided retail POS systems to thousands of merchants in a variety of industry verticals.</p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
<p>Inventory management becomes easier when the kitchen can quickly note when it runs out of an ingredient or dish. You can improve your Restaurant business by downloading our ready to use resources such as Restaurant Manager Duties Checklist, Essential Restaurant Equipment List, Liquor Cost Control Kit, Restaurant Business Plan & more.

For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
