<h3>How Are "Point Of Sale" (POS) Systems Different From A Cash Register Gridley California</h3>
<p>Traditionally, POS systems were on-premise, which means they used an on-site server and could only run in a specific area of your store. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table. You can accept payment right in the online invoice, and customers can pay by credit card, Apple Pay, free ACH bank transfer, or over the phone.</p>
<p>Gift cards continue to be the most requested gift item and a go-to gift idea for the holidays and for businesses. When hooked up to a POS system, the software can track exactly how many times a cash drawer is opened to cut down on fraud. Regardless whether taking orders over the phone or in person, the pizza POS software should guide the staff from greeting the customer through detailed order recording, through any up sells, and to the payment information, and finally the order fulfillment.</p>
