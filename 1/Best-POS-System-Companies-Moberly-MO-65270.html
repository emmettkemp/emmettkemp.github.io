<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Organize menu items, categories, choice sets and modifiers to customize your restaurant POS to meet the needs and offerings of your restaurant. Advanced, cloud-based retail POS system that comes with integrated payments, inventory management, and real-time reporting. Stay in touch about new products, features, and ways to maximize your business with your new POS system. Modern POS systems are commonly programmable or allow enhancement with third-party software programs.</p>
<p>With data connected in the Retail Pro POS platform, you can set up real time updates between applications and get better accuracy in stock management and order fulfillment. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>

<p>Point of sales systems of today function analogously to the commonplace personal computer and can run other software other than the standard POS software that is provided as standard with the purchase of the system. The Point of Sale (POS) is simply the place where a retail transaction takes place-it's the hardware and software used to physically accept payments and record transactions. To ensure that you do not sell to persons below 21 years of age, consider getting a POS system that can verify your customers' ages.</p>
