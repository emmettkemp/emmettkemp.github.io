<p>The right Point of Sale system will give you control over many different areas of your business operations increasing efficiency and profitability. Accept cash, credit card or other tender, then swipe for tableside service. Mobile POS systems are Cloud-based and substantially cheaper (but may be leaner in terms of extras). Features include order management, inventory tracking, a timeclock and sales analytics. The capturing of data at the time and place of sales by using personal computers or specialized terminals that are combined with cash registers, bar code readers, optical scanners and magnetic stripe readers for accurately and instantly capturing the transaction.</p>
<p>Retailers and restaurants can benefit from comprehensive data analytics and sales processing. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.
