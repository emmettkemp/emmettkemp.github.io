<p>Whether you're selling gardening supplies, trendy clothes, or high-end electronics, your retail store's success is largely connected to your cash management procedures. And an open API makes adding third-party applications far easier than with the majority of restaurant POS systems. Customers appreciate when their food is delivered on time, and when their orders are not mixed up. For a restaurant this could mean greater customer retention, and more satisfied clients. By empowering in-store associates with a customer's purchase history, online browsing, and cart abandons, POS can increase basket size and same-store sales, even as you drive loyalty by exceeding customer expectations.</p>
