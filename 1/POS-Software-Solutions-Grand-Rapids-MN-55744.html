<p>A gift shop needs specialist POS software if the business is to reach its full potential. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.

<p>Lightspeed is a great choice if you need to manage sales, inventory, and staff across multiple locations. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Finding the company that charges the least for credit card transactions is key, but you may also need a system that can accept cash or be willing to take your business cashless.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of restaurant POS software is the inclusion of a cash drawer (and potentially an iPad) to be used either at the counter or tableside. Make notes about customers to remember each client's personal preferences and to provide the best service. ETP has successfully executed over 500 enterprise software projects across 35,000+ stores for 300+ brands.

<p>And unsurprisingly, 71% of Americans think that a credit or debit card is the most convenient payment method. It provides flexible reporting and cost & labor saving inventory management tools that help identify vulnerable areas of the business. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic).</p>

<p>Before choosing one, you need to consider the numbers of departments and terminals, the work-load, the modes of payments, the type of computer operating system and database, whether accessible online or not, the hardware part of the system etc. Extensive inventory and reporting work well for mid-size restaurants or multiple locations with most of the features you need. The purpose was to keep employees and customers honest.</p>
