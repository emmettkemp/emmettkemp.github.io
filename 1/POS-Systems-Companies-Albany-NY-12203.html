Restaurant point of sale (POS) software provides restaurant and bar servers an easy way to take orders and process payment for multiple checks simultaneously. A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>But other retail locations may prefer a mobile POS for staff to use out on the floor.
