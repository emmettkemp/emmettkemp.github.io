<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software. It offers a choice of month-to-month or annual subscription plans for its POS software, and all of its plans support an unlimited number of users, customers and products. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>When you're shopping around for a POS system, keep in mind the different types of restaurant technology and bar management software out there. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software.</p>
