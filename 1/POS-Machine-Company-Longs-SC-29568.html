She has been with Merchant Maverick since 2015, writing about POS software, small business loans, and financing for women entrepreneurs. Typically, the term ‘ point of sale ' (often shortened to ‘POS') applies to the combined functions of a hardware device or devices and related software that provides the ability for a merchant such as a small business or sole trader to process payments for products or services.</p>
<p>With a bar POS system that plays nice with payroll systems, you can schedule shifts, track hours, and communicate like a boss. At our online store, you can easily select the best Point of Sale hardware for your small retail business.

<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM.
