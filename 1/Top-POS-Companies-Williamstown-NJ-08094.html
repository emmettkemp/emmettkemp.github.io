<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. Smartphone POS services can process payments and manage some inventory and customer information. The most basic and universal in-person payment method is the reading of a credit card magstripe via swipe. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. Keep customers coming back with seamless shopping experiences both in store and online.</p>
<p>You can then send them special offers and sale notices with Odoo Mailing Register tax identifications for your business customers and give them invoices instantly (or send by email). Mobile apps have turned phones into portable payment kiosks, minimizing hardware requirements, while enabling retailers to take the transaction from the counter to the sales floor and beyond.
