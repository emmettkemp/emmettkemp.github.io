Eliminating a fixed bar POS system can raise a bar's customer experience to new heights by creating a modern sales experience that is rife with today's latest technology. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. It also offers software for business intelligence, analytics and customer engagement.</p>
<p>Many POS systems include their own loyalty programs within their software, which is a huge plus. With a broad portfolio of point of sale devices, HP helps retailers and hospitality operators meet customers' needs anytime, anywhere. If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.

Our POS software is designed to suit a range of hospitality business types, from cafes and restaurants and bars to multi-site restaurant groups and national service organisations. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs.</p>
