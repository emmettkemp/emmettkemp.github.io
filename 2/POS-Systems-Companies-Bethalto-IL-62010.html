She has been with Merchant Maverick since 2015, writing about POS software, small business loans, and financing for women entrepreneurs. Typically, the term ‘ point of sale ' (often shortened to ‘POS') applies to the combined functions of a hardware device or devices and related software that provides the ability for a merchant such as a small business or sole trader to process payments for products or services.</p>

If you're currently using Shopify to sell online, or plan to expand your retail stores into the ecommerce space, then I highly recommend the Shopify POS system. On the other hand, the point of sale on the ecommerce platform is software working independent of hardware.
