Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing.</p>

<p>The Premium plan allows you to connect with additional business tools, including the ability to link in-store sales with ecommerce platforms. Apps designed to keep repeat business with customers and features like scan to pay, skip the line and rewards. The benefit of this is that it allows the programs to share sales figures and customer contact information, saving you the hassle of manually downloading it from one program and uploading it to the other.</p>
<p>The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software. Many products, including the ones we have reviewed here, serve as essential business hubs that handle everything from inventory, customer, and employee management to accounting, payroll, and shipping services. Many Nordstrom Rack stores combine static register POS terminals with mobile POS systems to allow employees to reduce lines at their traditional register stations - one or two employees can clear half a dozen shoppers from a line in relatively little time.</p>
