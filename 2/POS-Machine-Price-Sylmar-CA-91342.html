<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. A credit card swipe is integrated with the POS system to quickly and accurately approve the customer's credit card and to input the transaction into the system. IVend POS is Windows OS based software that allows for a variety of peripherals and device configurations, including scanners, cash drawers, displays and EMV-compliant card readers. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
<h2>Cloud Retail POS Software Sylmar</h2>

You don't need a valid internet connection to run this restaurant POS software. Payments can be by cash or credit and debit cards, or via convenient payment gateways.
