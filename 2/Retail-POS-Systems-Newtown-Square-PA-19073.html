Once the inventory code is entered, the systems call up the standard or sales price, compute the price at multiple quantities and provide a running total. To find the best POS systems for small businesses, we asked small business owners which systems they use and what they like and dislike about them.</p>
<p>Reporting: Most POS systems will also come with some form of base reporting If you're a smaller business or one that doesn't plan to rely on analytics much, you may be perfectly happy with a system with just a handful of basic reports. Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges.
