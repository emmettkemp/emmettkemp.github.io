<p>Integrating the POS system with Apparel ERP will demand an understanding and the need of POS system. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. Retail merchants, for example, can operate with an internet-enabled device, terminal stand, credit card reader, receipt printer, and cash drawer. Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing. HDRestaurant will come in handy in those situations, from billing to storing the addresses of the customer; the restaurant software takes care of everything easily.</p>

Management features include Payroll, EMV Chip Tabs, Employee activity tracking, Real time training, Extensive reporting, Automated discounting, Trade accounts, Gift cards, Tickets splinting, Customer head counts, Table management, Customer records, Void Comp Discount Waste Override and Theft tracking system.</p>
<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them. Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
