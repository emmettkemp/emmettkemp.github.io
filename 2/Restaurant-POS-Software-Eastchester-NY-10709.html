<p>As your business grows ShopKeep's retail store software is designed to help you pivot with advanced features. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>
<p>Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit. As a result of such extreme competitive pressures, modern POS has evolved far beyond a payment and accounting system to become not just point of sale, but also point of service, driving highly individualized interactions that consistently gratify customers in the moment.</p>
<p>In this article, we speak to two industry experts who'll share tips on what you must have in a POS and how to choose the best option for your retail store or restaurant.

<h3>Best Point Of Sale Software Eastchester New York</h3>
<p>PointOS was founded by bar and restaurant professionals to provide a cost effective, full-featured and user-friendly restaurant management platform that helps restaurants and bars operate more efficiently and profitably. This free POS software can perform all of the common register functions, track up to 13,000 SKU's, monitor sales of up to 56 employees, and handle daily sales reporting. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode. Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>
