A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode. Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>
