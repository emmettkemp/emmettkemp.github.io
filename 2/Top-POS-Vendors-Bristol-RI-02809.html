<p>Technology has been moving at an amazing avalanche pace. This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. Smartphone POS services can process payments and manage some inventory and customer information. The most basic and universal in-person payment method is the reading of a credit card magstripe via swipe. Keep a track of inventory and enjoy smooth sales operation. Keep customers coming back with seamless shopping experiences both in store and online.</p>
<p>Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
