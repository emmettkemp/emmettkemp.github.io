<p>Five years ago I began searching for an easy way to track my customers, my accounts receivable, and all the other aspects of my business. Delivery management: Manage order deliveries from start to finish, ensuring on-time customer delivery. Big and medium sized retail stores are using this application without fail. This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes. Accurate, real-time communications in Retail Pro help you keep your inventory and customer information up to date across the entire business, so you can make better decisions from holistic, integrated business insights.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<h2>What Is A POS System A Guide To Point Of Sale Features Mishawaka</h2>
<p>Retailers have the ability to implement special promotions or establish customer loyalty programs to encourage customers to purchase popular items. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. Traditional card machines require software installation (if not included) and SIM card or landline cable, while app-based card readers use WiFi or network data from a connected mobile device.</p>

<p>But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. It takes the payment of the customers by adding up the totals along with the sales tax. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to. Furthermore, it can serve as an advertising platform, where stores can run marketing messages and promotions, thereby potentially enhancing sales.</p>
