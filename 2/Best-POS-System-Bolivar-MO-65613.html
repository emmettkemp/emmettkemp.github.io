Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts.

Likewise, gift and loyalty programs—whether for retail or hospitality customers —can turn payment into a personalized guest experience in which you reward customers, run targeted promotions, and gather key data on preferences and behaviors.</p>
