<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Thus, a retail owner should take a careful matching of POS softwares and hardwares. It's our fastest reader ever - processing payments in seconds - and it's easy to integrate with our POS software. You should choose cloud-based bar POS software that enables order taking, payment processing, employee management, inventory tracking, data recording and real-time reporting. If you're in need of a POS that has great robust inventory management built in to it then I suggest you give the Hike a test and consider it.</p>
