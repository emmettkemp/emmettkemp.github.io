That kind of (costly) frustration can't occur in retail stores. Ultimately, inventory is synchronized with less human error that is simply getting you real-time data and result for your business. Without a POS System, your customers will have to stand in a long line to wait for their checkout turn.</p>

<p>The machine or system used by the restaurant to take your payment is termed their point of sale terminal. Cloud POS systems ensure all customer data is stored properly and securely. Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. Walmart stores suffered a major cyber attack on its POS system in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. These applications would typically provide the same core functions, so watch out for other things like the hardware you would need to purchase on top of the software or which mobile platform it runs on. You would also do well to keep a keen eye on vendor reputation for providing timely updates and customer service.</p>
