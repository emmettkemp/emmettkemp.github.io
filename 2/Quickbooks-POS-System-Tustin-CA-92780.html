Formerly known as iConnect, Franpos provides POS solutions with comprehensive features to franchise businesses. Our Point of Sale for Restaurants offers full stock control, debtors, creditors, recipe and staff management to manage your entire restaurant alongside all the great features that are required to keep you informed on what is happening in your business. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
<p>Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store. Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system.</p>

<p>The retail companies, grocery shops, and hospitality businesses like restaurants and hotels can benefit highly from a POS system. Retailer Lyn Evans created that kind of no-disappointment experience for their customers. POS systems can be extremely cheap or very expensive, and all charge a payment processing fee. It can also check your inventory numbers and sales to see if there are changes to your profits. As a retailer, it's necessary that you have an online store and as an online storeowner, it is necessary that your shopping cart integrate with your Dynamics RMS.</p>

In addition, Vend POS offers sales and inventory management, customer profiles, split and contactless payments, and gift cards. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
