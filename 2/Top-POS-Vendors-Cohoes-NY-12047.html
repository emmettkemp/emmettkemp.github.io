<p>Purchasing a restaurant POS system on the internet can be a complex process due to the number of systems and options. After the pen and paper way of taking orders, the next thing to enter the restaurant industry was the first POS system It was a basic cash register, a computer-based system introduced by IBM. 5. Point of sale systems allow you to track what customers purchase so that you can learn more about your customers, their buying habits, and personal preferences. Clover also features advanced loyalty tools to help you attract repeat customers.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>

The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment.</p>
<p>We went with Lightspeed POS and we have been pretty happy with this, there is one REALLY big drawback for small retailers. You can also adjust your product displays to give customers more buying options during peak selling times. HDRestaurant records your employees time in, time-out details and calculates employee working hours in bar and restaurant.

Real-time reporting â€” the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
