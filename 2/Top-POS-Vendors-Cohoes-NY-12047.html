<p>Purchasing a restaurant POS system on the internet can be a complex process due to the number of systems and options. After the pen and paper way of taking orders, the next thing to enter the restaurant industry was the first POS system It was a basic cash register, a computer-based system introduced by IBM. 5. Point of sale systems allow you to track what customers purchase so that you can learn more about your customers, their buying habits, and personal preferences. Clover also features advanced loyalty tools to help you attract repeat customers.</p>
<p>Features include order management, a delivery app for drivers, employee scheduling and a timeclock, ingredient-based inventory tracking, and reporting tools. The software is essentially an online ordering platform for restaurants, convenience stores, takeaways, multi-store chains, cafes, delis, and franchises. ShopKeep doesn't allow for multiple sales tax rates, doesn't integrate with any online stores, and can't handle payment with gift cards.</p>

Founded in 2009 and headquartered in San Francisco, Square markets a restaurant point-of-sale platform with software, hardware and payments to streamline operations. The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment.</p>
<p>We went with Lightspeed POS and we have been pretty happy with this, there is one REALLY big drawback for small retailers. You can also adjust your product displays to give customers more buying options during peak selling times. HDRestaurant records your employees time in, time-out details and calculates employee working hours in bar and restaurant.

<p>It is an active restaurant management system that helps you to maintain information privacy, maximize customer value by analysis of statistics, keeps you updated with the logistics & inventory requirements at all levels and restaurant chains and helps you achieve competitive advantages through custom reporting and business intelligence reports. Several POS companies have in-house payment processing services and either require you to use it with their POS system or pay an additional monthly fee or an additional percentage of each sale if you choose to use a different processor.</p>
<p>An added benefit of cloud-based POS software is that it eliminates the need for costly upgrades and minimizes security risks traditionally associated with client-server systems. Like most of the leading bars and restaurants, you probably allow your customers to tip their servers.

The inventory management module embedded in Lightspeed allows the business personnel to carry out their day to day activities in a highly organized manner. For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Real-time reporting — the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
