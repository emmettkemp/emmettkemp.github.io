<p>There are a lot of products which can be used in the restaurant or food franchising industry and one of them is through the use of the POS systems or Point of Sale systems. Operating a retail store calls for a range of administrative, management and marketing skills. Opting for a POS software provider that offers both proprietary and open source hardware, provides you with the most freedom and flexibility which ultimately results in the most bang for your buck. The cash drawer should be compatible with the rest of the system if purchasing the POS hardware separately. A mobile web study found out that smartphones were used in over a third of total US retail sales in 2018 or equivalent to more than $1 trillion in purchases.</p>

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment. It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. Here is an ugly truth: No matter how credit card improves, cash still holds its position on consumers' behavior.</p>
