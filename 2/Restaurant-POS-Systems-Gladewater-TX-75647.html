<p>Also, you'll want to have online access to see your labor costs and sales reports. There are hundreds of point of sale (POS) systems available to small businesses, and several are geared toward retail businesses specifically. It is important to anticipate your business growth and choose a bar POS system that will allow you to expand as you see fit. As a result of such extreme competitive pressures, modern POS has evolved far beyond a payment and accounting system to become not just point of sale, but also point of service, driving highly individualized interactions that consistently gratify customers in the moment.</p>
<p>Despite the cash register motif, however, when people talk about POS systems, they're mostly referring to the software, which could be client-based or cloud-based. There are a lot of specialized systems out there for the restaurant or hospitality business, so if you're selling flowers or handmade bags, make sure you find a POS tool with all of the bells and whistles to make your products sing and your customers stick around.</p>

<p>The basic purpose of a restaurant POS system is to facilitate orders and accept payment from customers. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. When you have enough personnel on the sales floor and at the cash wrap, shoppers intuitively get the message that they are worth your time and staff investment. Track customers' buying behaviors and create targeted marketing campaigns to retain current customers and win new business.</p>
<p>Employees will be thankful for the increased accuracy and ease of use - and they will be able to devote more time to customer service, since they won't be constantly called upon for menial tasks like fixing cash register errors. Best for established businesses looking to scale with advanced features and analytics. Traditionally, businesses set up POSs near store exits to increase the rate of impulse purchases as customers leave.</p>

<p>Inventory isn't a favorite topic among managers, but it's a top necessity for being ahead in a highly competitive business. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. Key features include floor management, customer and inventory tracking, table-side ordering and an offline mode. Retailers who meet this requirement first will build stronger relationships with customers, create space for innovation projects, and make more strategic decisions that maximize their growth.</p>

When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. Generally, if not for aesthetic purposes, the business is only using one of these because they do not have the budget for a better cash management system.</p>
