<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running. The smart restaurant POS software also allows you to split guest bills by food type and quantity.

<p>Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. It provides payment processing through Vantiv, and you can purchase its POS hardware either directly from the company or from Amazon. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings. Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems.</p>
