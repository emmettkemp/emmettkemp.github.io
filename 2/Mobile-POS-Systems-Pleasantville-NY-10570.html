<p>The newest revelations to take the restaurant and hospitality industries by force - quickly etching its way into "trendsetter" capacity - are point-of-sale systems that are powered by feature-rich and slim iPad tablets.

The software streamlines the process of ordering and payment as well as back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house communications to help businesses save costs and boost earnings. Because staff can use the pos computer equipment to check what stock is in the storeroom, the staff member does not have to leave the register to check if that top the customer wants comes in blue or not.</p>
