While its Square Point of Sale App is an all-in-one software for pretty much any business, Square for Restaurants is rather an optimized version with the specific features that restaurant business owners need. POS functions include employee scheduling and management, sales reporting, inventory management and more.</p>

<h3>Purchase POS System Brandon FL 33511</h3>
<p>Miva Merchant is an example of an ecommerce tool that comes with a robust POS system for your retail business. If you're using Quickbooks, for example, your bar point of sale software should allow you to integrate your sales data into your established Quickbooks reports. As more customers prefer to pay with credit or debit cards, make sure your POS system has integrated credit card processing with fair rates.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
