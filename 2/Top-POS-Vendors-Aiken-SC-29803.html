<h3>Brief History Of Point Of Sale Aiken South Carolina</h3>
<p>You have access to features like table management, delivery, and cash management. POS software designed specifically for retailers won't necessarily support the needs of a business in the foodservice and restaurant industry. Entry level systems begin at around $500 for the hardware and a monthly subscription price for the software of about $50.
