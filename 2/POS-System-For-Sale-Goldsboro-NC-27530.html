<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before the introduction of technology into the restaurants, bills were traditionally generated by merely calculating the order value manually and giving customers a handwritten receipt. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success. It is advisable to use your POS computer exclusively for the purpose it is meant for - recording sales transactions, generating reports and managing inventory.</p>

Toast comes with an amazing array of built-in features, including an integrated online ordering system, a loyalty rewards program, the ability to generate, accept, and sell gift cards (both digital and physical), and a recently added restaurant inventory management system.</p>
<p>With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.

For a restaurant, it's especially important to turn over tables quickly and ensure that customers receive the correct food (with any special orders accommodated) in a timely fashion.</p>
