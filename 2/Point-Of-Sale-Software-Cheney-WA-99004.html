<p>With the technology boom, Electronic Cash Registers (ECR) — later termed Point-of-Sale systems — have become this option, expanding beyond the transaction register to cloud-based POS applications that allow complete control over multiple global retail lines. A Guest Manager iOS app can be added to Cake's basic POS software in order to allow online order management. The POS-integrated restaurant management system provides all the tools to run your frontend and backend operations. We present small retailers the freedom to sell, manage daily operations, and grow their retail store business in every way possible. Even before the actual transaction, your employees or you will need to ring your customers up. In this crucial step, your point of sale shouldn't slow down the process—having a point of sale system with an easily navigable inventory catalog for quickly ringing up customers will seriously speed up your checkout process.</p>
