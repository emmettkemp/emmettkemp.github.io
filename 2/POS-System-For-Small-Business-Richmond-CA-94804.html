This can help attract repeat business and effectively help you market to interested customers. Since your ecommerce and in-store solution will be connected with Shopify POS, customers will have the ability to return or exchange an online purchase at a local retail location. If the POS system holds data on recent purchases at the supermarket, then in order to transfer that data to ERP, the employee will have to input that information again in the ERP system in order to ensure proper accounting of the supermarket's cash flow.</p>
<p>For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.
