<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>
<p>Gone are those days when retailers used a cash register to process sales after which the data was transferred to accounts and stock list. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more. Whether you have single or multiple stores, our tools help run your business. A decent POS computer system provides features to manage a large company database, that can be conceivably shared amongst multiple store locations.</p>

Our standard restaurant point of sale includes a touchscreen POS terminal, cash drawer, receipt printer, and kitchen printer.</p>

Revel is a hybrid POS system that stores data in the cloud, but it also leverages a local network to sync your sales data between iPads.</p>

Thousands of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and food service establishments have chosen SoftTouch POS. You get both the hardware (terminal, receipt printer, and cash drawer) along with the hospitality EPOS software. Zomato Book lets restaurants cater to a wide and varied customer range.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. These businesses should look for features like invoicing, e-commerce, and CRM. Proper use of these functions helps pinpoint the causes of inventory loss, reduces "out of stock" conditions and makes overall business management easier.
