<p>It offers three separate point of sale systems, each with its own retail-oriented service package. Before you decide on the best restaurant POS system for you, take some time to do a little research. STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits. Identifying your point-of-sale needs can be as easy as finding out what your competitors (or other businesses similar to yours) are using or as difficult as performing an in-depth study of every transaction you process.</p>
