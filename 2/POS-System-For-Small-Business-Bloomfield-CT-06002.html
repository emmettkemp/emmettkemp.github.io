<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. With this, you can also manage payments and seamlessly track sales and profits. But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place. To begin with, as you make sales, the system should be able to track what has been sold, how many items still remain, when you are out of that item, and notify you ahead of time so that you can restock.</p>

<p>Just be aware that some systems charge extra for access to inventory management or advanced inventory management features. She has been with Merchant Maverick since 2015, writing about POS software, small business loans, and financing for women entrepreneurs. Typically, the term ‘ point of sale ' (often shortened to ‘POS') applies to the combined functions of a hardware device or devices and related software that provides the ability for a merchant such as a small business or sole trader to process payments for products or services.</p>
