<h3>Brief History Of Point Of Sale Tracy California</h3>
<p>It offers three separate point of sale systems, each with its own retail-oriented service package. Before you decide on the best restaurant POS system for you, take some time to do a little research. STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits. Identifying your point-of-sale needs can be as easy as finding out what your competitors (or other businesses similar to yours) are using or as difficult as performing an in-depth study of every transaction you process.</p>
<p>Now, customers can walk into a bar and grill having already placed their order before they left the office. You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Chris Ligan, vice president of acquisitions at credit card processing company Auric , listed a few must-haves that every business, bar or otherwise, should look for in a POS system. Small businesses can take advantage of simple credit card processing, which is integrated with Quickbooks and encrypted for the protection of the business and its customers' data.</p>
