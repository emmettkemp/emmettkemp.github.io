QuickBooks Point of Sale Pro Package - offers advanced tools and allows several options for customization so you can manage sales, inventory, and your customers in the way that you want. As well, businesses can keep track of peak selling periods so they can adjust employee schedules based on the time of day when the volume of traffic is high.</p>
<p>Some point of sale systems will go a step further—they'll allow you to make inventory orders within their software. As any bar manager or beverage director knows, bar inventory management is the beating heart of a well-run, profitable bar. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. TouchBistro features a good mix of bar-specific features that help you manage catering, reservations, and deliveries.</p>
