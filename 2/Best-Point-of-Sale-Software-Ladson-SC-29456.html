<p>The market for POS software system is expanding among retailers. Because hardware can be a significant expense, you may be reluctant to buy more than the bare minimum, but your restaurant will work more efficiently if you purchase enough hardware so employees aren't doubling up. Increase sales and profit, by serving your customers faster and avoid common mistakes that happen in the point of sale checkout lane. The software typically encompasses a myriad of functions, including payment processing and staff, customer, and inventory management.</p>
<p>Since implementation of a POS system is requires a large investment in time and money, the selection of software and hardware requires careful research into the features available and associated costs. For keyed-in transactions, customers pay a 3.5% transaction cost plus $0.15. Customers who personally use their card to dip, tap, and swipe, they pay slightly lower transaction fees (2.75%). Many small businesses benefit from buying their POS hardware outright, since POS leases can be tied to credit card processing and have lengthy contracts.</p>
