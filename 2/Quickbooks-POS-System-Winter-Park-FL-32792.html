STEM is an integrated suite of retail and hospitality management modules that enable you to manage your businesses successfully and maximize profits. Identifying your point-of-sale needs can be as easy as finding out what your competitors (or other businesses similar to yours) are using or as difficult as performing an in-depth study of every transaction you process.</p>
