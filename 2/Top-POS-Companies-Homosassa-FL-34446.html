Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones.

<p>With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products. The user can use cash, debit cards, mobile payments, or credit cards for the payment.
