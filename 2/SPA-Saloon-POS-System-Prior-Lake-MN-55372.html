<p>You should look at POS systems for bars that allow for integration with your existing accounting software. For these reasons, many cash registers systems are being dropped for the more modern POS systems.

Retail operations such as hardware stores (lumber yards), electronic stores and so-called multifaceted superstores need specialized additional features compared to other stores.</p>
<p>A few services, such as Square Point of Sale, offer POS services for free, as long as you process your payments through them. Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.
