With core functionalities built around inventory management, ecommerce, analytics, and customer loyalty, it helps you boost product management as well as track and organize customer data.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well.

Once again, here's our quick look at the three POS services that rise above the rest when it comes to features, support, and pricing.
