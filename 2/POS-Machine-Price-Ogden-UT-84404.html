<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. Many POS systems run on tablets, an option that is increasingly popular with small business owners because they're less expensive and easier to set up and use than their old-school counterparts. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments. Be cautious, therefore, about setting up with Quickbooks or other proprietary POS software systems.</p>
<p>Expiry Management: This software for restaurant billing in India assists in tracking expiry date of ingredients, so that you can return items to suppliers on time. Card payment starts by swiping the card - through MSR or a handheld device then taking customer's authorization for the specified amount. Plus, Cova is seed-to-sale compliant, integrating with statewide traceability systems like BioTrackTHC, Leaf Data Systems, and Metrc.</p>
