Your POS equipment can provide your customers with more information on the product, and can even suggest additional products that match the original sale to make the upsale easier. Good point-of-sales software should let you receive payment for services and products. The software integrates well with other systems from Sysco like Cake OrderPad, Cake Guest Manager, and Cake Online Ordering.</p>
<p>Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service. Using integrated technology to track data helps retailers catch discrepancies in pricing or cash flow that could lead to profit loss or interrupt sales. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
